# Resolution-of-Satellite-images-for-Landslide-hazard
This project focuses on detecting landslides using high-resolution satellite images and deep learning models like U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and FCN-8. It processes a dataset of 3960 images to train models for accurate segmentation of landslide-prone areas. The models are evaluated using metrics like IoU, Precision, Recall, and Dice Score.
